TimeSeriesMNDWI_Brazil is a script for the javascript Earth Engine API, designed to provide a time series of the 
Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) for an area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
The time series uses Landsat 8 data from August, 2014 through August 2016, as this was a time of drought in Brazil.
The area chosen surrounded an important reservior system in Sao Paulo that was impacted by the drought, which is shown in the fluctuating MNDWI values for the region. 
The script takes advantage of a recommended cloud-masking function for landsat 8 SR images.
