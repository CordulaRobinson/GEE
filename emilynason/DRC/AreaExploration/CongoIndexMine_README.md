The CongoIndexMine.ipynb file contains a script for Google Earth Engine through the Python API. 
This script focuses on a selected area in southern DRC, near a concentrated area of known mines. 
This calculates images for a 6 month period in both 2016 and 2021 using Landsat-8 data, including true color composites, 
NDVIs, VIGS indices, Clay indices, and Iron indices. 
The changes in these indices between 2016 and 2021 are also calculated, and added to the map to highlight possible mine locations. 
The final section of the file compiles the above information into a final mine area estimate for 2016 and 2021, which is visualized on a map.
