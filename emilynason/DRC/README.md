"Final" folder contains all files that I believe are relevant to the project as of 6/30/2022.  
This includes files relating to our current mine detection routine, and any files used to create images, charts, and tables used in the paper.

"Old_Routines" folder contains our previously used, step-by-step code for mine detection process.  
Parts of this code may not be up to date, but can be used as a way to better understand how our current routine works.

"Old" folder contains all files used for data exploration in the DRC that helped to inform our current routine.
