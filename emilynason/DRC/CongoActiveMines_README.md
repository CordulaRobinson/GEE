The CongoActiveMines.ipynb file contains a python script that connects to the Google Earth Engine API.
This script focuses the map onto the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
Using data from the IPIS Research Institute, the script maps out known active mines in the DRC. 
Most of these are found in the Eastern half, represented by blue dots. 
The script also filters out mines that have "Coltan" listed as one of their top three minerals sourced.
Coltan is the ore that can contain tantalum. These are represented on the map with red dots.
