The CongoMinesNDVI file contains a script for the Google Earth Engine JavaScript API.
This script focuses on a selected area in southern DRC, near a concentrated area of known mines. 
This calculates images for a 6 month period in both 2019 and 2021, including true color composites, NDVIs, 
and Possible Mining Areas based on low NDVI values that are not known bodies of water. 
The script also compared the growth of possible mining activity between the given years.
