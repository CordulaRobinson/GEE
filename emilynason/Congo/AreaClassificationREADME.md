The AreaClassification-1-19-2022 file contains a script for the Google Earth Engine Javascript API. 
This script goes to a preselected area near the Eastern border of the DRC that contains previously recognized mines, and utilizes Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance data
The layers mapped in this script include the geometric outline, the known mine locations, composite true color images for 6 month periods in 2019 and 2021, 
classifications of bare soil, water, vegetation, and clouds for both years, areas where vegetation in 2019 became classified as something else in 2021, and 
areas where vegetation in 2019 became bare soil by 2021. That last layer can be interpreted as possible areas of new or increased mining activity.
